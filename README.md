# WebTech Course Section A - Lab Tasks

Welcome to the **WebTech Course Section A** repository, where I am uploading my course and lab tasks. This repository includes the implementation of web pages for the tasks assigned in the course. Each lab performance is organized in separate sections, and you can explore the code and descriptions below.

## Lab Task Overview

### Lab Performance 1: User Management Pages

In this lab task, I have created a simple user management system consisting of four core pages: **Login**, **Register**, **Forgot Password**, and **Home**. These pages are used for managing user accounts, allowing users to log in, register new accounts, reset forgotten passwords, and view their profile once logged in.

The pages are organized inside the `lab-performance-1` folder, which includes:

- **Login Page**: This page allows users to log in using their email and password. If the user has forgotten their password, they can navigate to the **Forgot Password** page.
  
- **Register Page**: New users can sign up by providing their first and last name, email, password, and a profile picture.

- **Forgot Password Page**: This page helps users reset their password by verifying their registered email and entering an OTP (One-Time Password).

- **Home Page**: Once logged in, users will be directed to their profile page, which displays their personal information, such as email and department.

Additionally, the folder contains a **`main.css`** file, which is used to style all the web pages to ensure a consistent look and feel across the system.
